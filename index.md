# Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm Chellappa.

This blog documents my journey toward becoming a skilled Cloud and Backend Engineer.

I’m currently preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate certification and sharing:

- Structured notes on core AWS services
- Hands-on labs and implementation walkthroughs

All content is based on practical learning and experimentation on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This blog is not just theory.

Every post focuses on:

- Why a service exists
- When to use it
- Common architectural patterns
- Real implementation examples
- Best practices for production-ready systems

As I learn, this space will also expand into:

- Backend Engineering
- System Design
- APIs and Microservices
- Databases
- DevOps fundamentals

## 🎯 Goal

To build scalable, secure, and reliable systems — and document the process openly to help other aspiring engineers.

Thanks for visiting. Let’s build and learn together.
